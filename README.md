**Bloodline**
(Blockchain PoC by [WowLabz](http://wowlabz.com) for the [Proffer Hackathon](https://proffer.network/hackathon))
================
    Motivation
The current ecosystem of blood donation, storage, and redemption of blood is broken, non-transparent, and inefficient. There is no way for donors to view current needs around them, and track their past donations, and for those in need to create a requests for blood, and also redeem their past donations for current need.
The data behind all the donations are owned by the blood banks providing no insight into the current state of donations. Acquiring systems to manage these is cumbersome and adoption at scale is a challenge, leading to fragmentation of technologies being adopted and neither do the systems communicate with each other.

    Goals
Make it easy for people to donate blood to those in need and receive tokens (a form of acknowledgement that can be redeemed in the future).
Make it hassle free for people in need to request for blood and send equivalent amount of tokens in return in a time sensitive manner to ensure those in need face the least amount of hurdles.
Provide transparency to the entire process that will aid utilization of blood based on demand and supply and also allow innovation on top of the data available.
This lead to the conceptualization and creation of Bloodline based on the Etherium Blockchain.

To participate in the Bloodline Crowdsale using test ETH:
 1. Connect to the **Ropsten** test network in your [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en).
 2. Send any amount of ETH(say x) greater than 1 wei to the Crowdsale contract address - **0xb6d7a8a3113ef0c177f49a5982906eb82ae03b85**
 3. Receive 10000*x BLC or Bloodline Coins in return.
 4. Check your BLC balance in Metamask by adding the token with the token contract address - **0x72b34ed41c5caf657c8f084c68c1e6d6d136bc4e**, symbol - **BLC** and decimals - **18**.
 
 Total Supply of BLC = **200000000**
 Crowdsale allocation of BLC = **100000000**
